# Jenkinsfile - making the easy things easy

![Great](great.jpg)

This plugin aims to build out a DSL for Jenkinfile (pipeline as code) to make the easy things easy, without taking away any of the power of Jenkins Pipeline for when you really need it.
added this nifty line as a test

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/plugins/job/simple-build-for-pipeline-plugin/badge/icon)](https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/plugins/job/simple-build-for-pipeline-plugin/)

# Example

This example runs a very simple build with some environment variables. This would work with pipeline-as-code and branch source.

This should be familiar and declarative-ish looking to anyone familiar with tools like .travis.yml, however, it is implemented as a pipeline DSL (so you can do all the other powerful pipeline things). 

```
simpleBuild {
 
    env = [
        FOO : 42,
        BAR : "YASS"
    ]
    

    before_script = "echo before"
    script = 'echo after $FOO'
    
    
    notifications = [
        email : "mneale@cloudbees.com"    
    ]
    
    
}
```

It will do the right thing, and send emails when things break. 

Optional things: You can specify a machine label, and/or a docker image to run builds under: 

```
machine = "hi-speed"
docker_image = "java:1.9"
```

See src/main/resources for the actual DSL used for the details.

To play with this:

`mvn hpi:run`

 or build and install it to your Jenkins (it is just a plugin). You can also commit the simpleBuild.groovy to the Jenkins workflowLibs repo (if you know what I mean, if not... then ignore me!).

 # Secondary aim

 The secondary aim of this plugin is to show how plain pipeline-script can be used easily to make a plugin to allow you to share the DSL.
 The only code you need to care about is the `src/main/resources/dslsimpleBuild.groovy` and `SimpleBuildDSL.java` - that is all.
 
 # TODO
- [ ] More scenario tests of the permutations
- [ ] Use named stages (?) if it makes sense. 
- [ ] Support all the same _script semantics as https://github.com/jenkinsci/simple-travis-runner-plugin/blob/pure-script-approach/README.md (eg after_failure, after_success etc to happen on the appropriate events and around error handling). 
- [ ] Allow execution of all `script` entries even if one fails (?)
- [ ] Time out individual `script` entries.
- [ ] Add in simple matrix (a la travis)
- [ ] Add in branch inclusions/exclusions (what branches to run on or not)
- [ ] Allow parallel scripts (across nodes?? or a whole block of parallel?)
- [ ] Implement auto-generation of `script` and friends for (some) languages? Debatable whether to do this.
- [ ] Decide whether to keep emulating Travis's behavior of ignore `after_*` steps' failures when setting build status.
- [ ] allow block for simple user input
- [ ] More notification types (slack, for example)
- [ ] Change email to only be on failure or return to health (convention, Yo). 
- [ ] Retries of scripts if specified
- [ ] May need to configure docker to work under a node() block...
